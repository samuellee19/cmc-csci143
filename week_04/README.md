# Week 04: More SQL

What you must know for the homework/midterm

1. skipping sections 5,6 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. good to know, but they're not "hard" concepts
    1. I personally don't use them frequently

1. joins
    1. sections 3 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. the "standard" explanation of joins uses venn diagrams, but this is technically not correct since relations are not sets; see: https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/
    1. joins meme

1. subqueries
    1. sections 7-8 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. compared to joins:
        1. every join can be written as a cross join + subquery
        1. some subqueries can be written as joins
        1. a subquery cannot be written as a join if it contains an aggregate function
    1. alternative reference on subqueries vs joins: https://learnsql.com/blog/subquery-vs-join/

<!--
1. `CREATE TABLE`
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-table/
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-data-types/
    1. Examples in the tutorial use `VARCHAR`, but you shouldn't use this type in postgresql.
       Instead, you should use the `TEXT` type.
       See: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_varchar.28n.29_by_default

1. `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`
